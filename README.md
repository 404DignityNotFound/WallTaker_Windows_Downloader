# WallTaker_Windows_Downloader
A walltaker download for windows, it downloads images from the link ID's you provide
how to use:
1. in config.txt put all the link id's you wanna grab as a new line, one id per line like the example shows - from 1 id to infinite, or until you run out of HDD space :P
2. double click the app icon to start it, afew minutes later you'll see a download folder appear - it'll always make the folder in the same directory it is ran from
3. ???
4. profit! (paid in walltaker pics obvs)
